STATUS_TRANSACTION: collects param transaction_ref, payment_method and reference which are not supposed to, bcus i am here to check status (1) i may not know the payment method (2) the frontend may not know the reference (3) after test i see the backend doesn't validate these datas only transaction_ref is use to check status

REFERENCE: we parsing reference is not recommended bcus even we can always make it unique its still not recommended btw i see no where the reference we pass on is useful since we can always track with the ERCASPAY reference which is Good enough, same same instead if us having extra table to keep our reference and urs we can just have urs and if for more unique in ur backend at least u use the timestamp and u got the user email thats enough, not even just that each id is within merchant account.
